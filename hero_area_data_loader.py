    ### (5+1) Key Differentials of My Professional Offering

    - **High-Performance Predictive Analytics**: I research and implement techniques for regression, classification, and forecasting use cases, 
      with applications ranging from macroeconomic and financial forecasting to microdata predictions in various systems.
    - **Software for Inference Distribution**: I develop applications (batch scripts, APIs, dashboards, web applications) to distribute insights 
      and predictions across corporate environments.
    - **Data Transformation Expertise**: As my former boss Susana Martinez Restrepo said, "I can perform data miracles." This refers to my 
      ability to clean and organize datasets from complex, multi-source environments for research and model development.
    - **Holistic Understanding of Modern Tooling**: I integrate tools and technologies for modern data analysis, committing to research the 
      unique purposes of each tool and efficiently write workflows around them using GPT.
        - *Excellence Tier* (I know the code line by heart): Python, R Studio, Stata, GPT.
        - *Proficiency Tier*: Airflow, SQL, Spark, Bash scripting.
        - *Currently Learning*: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, Big Data Cloud tools, SQLAlchemy, Django.
    - **AI & LLM Disruption in Software Development**: I prepare myself by means of self-learning for the disruption of Artificial Intelligence in software development and the rise of LLM-powered applications.
    - **Bonus: Rigorous Economic Mindset**: As an economist, I approach data analysis with a focus on causal reasoning, marginal effects, and 
      counterfactual analysis.
