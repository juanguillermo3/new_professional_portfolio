    "description": "This function assesses the balance of independent variables across treatment and control groups by performing statistical tests (e.g., T-tests for continuous variables, Proportion tests for binary variables). It calculates the differences between the treatment and control groups, p-values, and adds significance markers (e.g., stars) for each variable. The output is a data frame with the assessment results, including subsample sizes for both groups.",
