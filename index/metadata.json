My client, a **doctoral candidate**, ventured deep into the **Australian jungle** to collect extensive **field data** encompassing diverse aspects of **behavior, dietary habits, vegetation,** and **living environments**. Our **statistical analysis** aims to understand how monkeys allocate their **time budgets** across different behaviors and how various **contextual factors**\u2014such as **time of day, seasonality, weather, species,** and **reproductive status**\u2014as well as **individual-level traits** like **sex** and **group membership** influence these behaviors. This project highlights the versatility of **multivariate statistics** in **behavioral research**, and its findings offer valuable insights, even for **marketing projects** targeting monkeys or similar species.",
